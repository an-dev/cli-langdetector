Ex, I can say: eum saltantem inveni = I found him dancing: Marcus saltans cantabat = Marcus sang (as he was) dancing; ei saltanti poculum dedi = as he was dancing, I gave him a cup (literally "to him dancing I gave a cup"); Marci saltantis manum tenebam = I was holding Marc's hand as he was dancing (lit. I was holding Marc dancing's hand), omnes saltantes gaudebamus = (as we were) all dancing we were rejoicing... But you can't say saltans est for "he is dancing" (that would simply be saltat, same as for "he dances".)
